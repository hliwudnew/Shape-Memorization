Project Title: Shape Memorization
A grid or variable size is displayed to the user, consisting of randomized shapes of various colors. The user must memorize the grid, and then duplicate it on a blank grid from memory. The best times and scores will be shown to a user in a leaderboard, with higher accuracies giving a higher score. If a given grid is completed successfully, more grids with less patterns and greater size will be shown until the user fails.

Functional Requirements:
* The program on start shows the user a menu screen which displays a leaderboard button, start button, and help button
* The user can learn how to play the game by clicking the help button
* The game can be started when the start button is clicked
* The game ends if the user gets the pattern incorrect, which takes them back to the main menu
* Each time a pattern on a grid is solved, the grid will expand and generate a new pattern
* The pattern is scrambled within the grid each time a new game starts, or when a larger grid is generated
* Top scores and times are listed in the leaderboard, by clicking the button on the main menu
* After a game users can submit their score with a name they input, which will be displayed on the leaderboard
* 9
* 10
